## Presentation
Welcome to the Soil Analysis Program. This software, known as the MOHID SOIL TOOL (MST), is designed to process soil texture data and estimate hydraulic soil parameters for hydrological modeling. Developed using Python 3, MST features a graphical user interface (GUI) and is compatible with Windows 10/11 x64 operating systems. The executable version of MST can be accessed from the GitHub repository at [MOHID SOIL TOOL](https://github.com/dhiegosales/MOHID_SOIL_TOOL), ensuring accessibility and ease of use. MST was specifically developed to support hydrological studies by providing precise soil parameter inputs required for models like MOHID-Land.

## Introduction
MOHID Land is an open-source hydrological model, programmed in Fortran, based on physical principles, spatially distributed, and capable of simulating the various phases of the hydrological cycle. The partial differential equations for mass conservation are solved using the finite volume approach, where each cell has a defined volume, all its properties are homogeneous within, and the velocities are homogeneous on the faces of the volume [1].

The soil is discretized in a 3D domain, where the upper boundary is the topography, and the lower boundary is defined by the user. Between these boundaries, the soil is defined in vertical horizons, which may have different hydraulic properties and thicknesses. MOHID Land calculates soil water retention using the van Genuchten model, which depends on the following hydraulic properties: ùúÉùë†, the saturated water content; ùúÉùëü, the residual water content; ùõº, related to the inverse of the air entry pressure; ùëõ, a measure of pore size distribution; and ùêæùë†ùëéùë°, the saturated hydraulic conductivity [2].

Establishing the values for all these hydraulic properties for each soil type within a watershed and for each defined horizon is a labor-intensive task that requires research and technical expertise from the modeler, making it a significant challenge in hydrological modeling. Given the complexity of obtaining soil hydraulic properties, the Artificial Neural Network-based model Rosetta was developed [3, 4, 5]. This model uses more easily obtainable physical parameters to estimate the soil's hydraulic properties, such as the percentages of sand, silt, and clay; soil bulk density; volumetric water content at 33 kPa; and volumetric water content at 1500 kPa. It features a web interface [6], an R API [7], and a Python API [8].

The Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA) is responsible for mapping the soil types across the country and their various properties, providing several geospatial products in raster and shapefile formats for download on the portal http://geoinfo.dados.embrapa.br. The input parameters for the Rosetta model (sand, clay, silt, and bulk density) are estimated by EMBRAPA from nationwide sampling, then interpolated using statistical procedures and spatialized into 90m resolution pixels at various depths (0-5, 5-15, 15-30, 30-60, 60-100, and 100-200 cm) [9, 10].

Through exhaustive geoprocessing procedures, data on sand, silt, clay, and bulk density can be extracted from EMBRAPA's products for each soil type, input into one of the Rosetta versions, and used to create ASCII files, which are then implemented in MOHID Land. Given the time-consuming, repetitive, and exhaustive nature of data processing and file creation for MOHID Land, the application of the MOHID SOIL TOOL is fully justified.

The MOHID SOIL TOOL is a Windows 10/11 x64-based graphical interface tool developed in Python 3, designed to streamline the preparation of data for the MOHID Land hydrological model. It follows a comprehensive process, starting with the import and preprocessing of soil physical parameters provided by EMBRAPA. The tool then simulates soil compaction and calculates the hydraulic properties for each soil type within the user's watershed using the Rosetta-soil Python API. Additionally, it adjusts Van Genuchten-Mualem (VGM) parameters and constructs the necessary ASCII input files for the MOHID Land model, along with any accessory files. This approach makes the entire process more efficient and intuitive, significantly saving time in the development of hydrological models.

## Detailed Description of MOHID SOIL TOOL

### Integration with MOHID-Land
MOHID-Land is a hydrological modeling system utilizing the finite volume method to solve mass and momentum conservation equations. It includes horizontal and vertical discretization, drainage network derivation from elevation data, and uses Darcy's Law and Richards Equation for water movement calculations. MOHID-Land requires soil hydraulic parameters (such as Ksat, Œ∏s, Œ∏r, Œ±, and n) estimated from soil attributes using pedotransfer functions like Rosetta's. MST calculates these parameters and formats them for seamless integration into MOHID-Land.

### Main Features and Workflow
**a) Data Import**
- **Importing Files:** Users import watershed shapefiles (*.shp) and soil texture rasters (sand, silt, clay, bulk density *.tif).
   - Watershed shapefile: user study area
   - Soil type map:
      - MOHID GRID: The user can provide the path to the .dat file generated by MOHID-Land for the project's topography. Note that large grid domains may result in long processing times, possibly hours.
      - USER: The user can import their own shapefile containing soil type polygons. In this case, the user must specify the column in the 'Attribute Table' that contains the soil type data.
      - EMBRAPA: MST allows high-resolution options for Rio de Janeiro or Brazil soil type shapefiles, extending the application nationwide. If the user‚Äôs study area is not fully contained within the Rio de Janeiro map, the Brazil map should be used.
   - Layers raster: the user can load up to 6 Embrapa layer files, including:
      - Brazil sand raster (provided by Embrapa)
      - Brazil silt raster (provided by Embrapa)
      - Brazil clay raster (provided by Embrapa)
      - Density raster (provided by Embrapa)
   - *The tool is versatile and flexible, allowing the incorporation of any available raster data from both global and local sources into the study.
        
**b) Processing Input Files:** The tool clips soil type shapefiles using the watershed shapefile as a mask and calculates percentages of sand, silt, clay, and density for each soil polygon within the watershed folowuing these steps:
   - Processing Shapefiles:
     - The program reads and processes shapefiles for soil data.
     - Performs reprojection of shapefiles to EPSG:5880.
     - Clips soil maps based on user-defined watershed boundaries.
     - Dissolves soil types within the watershed. If MOHID grid, it is not performed.
   - Processing raster:
      - Extract quantitative data for each soil property: sand, silt, clay, and density using clipped shapefile. The raster data is clustering by mean, median, max or min statistics.
      - Sum sand, silt and clay.
      - Calculating the percentage of sand, silt and clay.
      - Soil Texture Classification:
         - Soil texture classification is now integrated, allowing the program to automatically determine the texture class of each soil in the watershed.
         - The classification results are included in both the Excel report and the attributes table of the exported Shapefile, providing better soil data analysis.
         - **Soil Texture Triangle:** Below is the soil texture triangle used in the program for classification:

  ![Soil Texture Triangle](https://github.com/dhiegosales/MOHID-SOIL-TOOL/blob/main/Textural_Triangle_for_Soil_Classification.png)
           
**c) Soil Compaction Assessment:** 

This module aims to simulate soil compaction, a crucial process that influences various physical and chemical properties of the soil, such as its density, porosity, and water retention capacity. The simulation is conducted by reading data from a table that contains information about the soil and assigning a 'Density Multiplier' that represents the desired level of compaction.

Upon initiating the simulation, the system reads the table and sets a default value of 1 for the 'Density Multiplier,' indicating no compaction. This value can be adjusted based on the specific conditions of the soil being modeled. After reading the data, applying the multiplier allows the system to calculate the new density of the soil, reflecting the effects of compaction. This step is essential, as variations in density simulate the impact of compaction, which can influence soil permeability, nutrient availability, and structural stability in engineering projects.

**d) Rosetta Hydraulic Parameter Estiamtion:** Utilizing Rosetta API, MST estimates hydraulic properties using the Rosetta API (compatible with versions 1, 2, or 3) based on EMBRAPA texture data.

**e) Rosetta Hydraulic Parameters Calibration:** Users adjust VGM parameters (Œ∏r, Œ∏s, Œ±, n, Ksat) by multiplying each with a user-defined factor. This feature enhances model sensitivity and reliability across diverse hydrological scenarios.

**f) Data Export**
- **Exporting Files:** MST exports processed data in ASCII format for MOHID-Land, shapefiles with clipped soil types, and Excel spreadsheets containing calculated percentages and parameter values.

### Operational Algorithm
The operational algorithm ensures precise processing from data importation to final export, supporting robust scientific analysis and streamlining workflows for water resource studies.

## Troubleshooting
- If the program closes unexpectedly or freezes, please check the following:<br>
a) Ensure that the input file names are correct.<br>
b) Verify that none of the input files are corrupted (we recommend testing all files in a GIS software like QGIS).<br>
c) Ensure no file in the export directory is not open with the same name as the one you are trying to save.<br><br>
If so, close the file before saving again. If the program fails to open, check the following:<br>
a) Make sure your antivirus is not blocking the program. If necessary, disable the antivirus while running the MOHID SOIL TOOL.<br><br>
If the exported shapefile is only partially filled (incorrect size), verify the following:<br>
a) Ensure that the user-provided shapefile (study area) is fully contained within the provided soil type map shapefile.<br><br>

## Field Auto-Filling

### Description
This function is designed to automatically fill the fields in graphical user interface (GUI) windows based on the last execution of the program. If the `inputFileNames.txt` file is not found in the current directory, the fields are initialized as empty or with default values. If the file exists, the values contained within it are read and used to populate the corresponding fields in the interface.

This approach facilitates the continuity of work, allowing parameters and files used in the previous execution to be automatically reused.

#### Function Logic
1. **File Existence Check**: The program checks if the `inputFileNames.txt` file exists in the current directory.
2. **Field Initialization**: If the file is not found, the fields are initialized as empty or with default values.
3. **Reading Values**: If the file is found, its values are read and used to fill the GUI fields.
4. **Parameters**: The filled parameters include input file paths (such as shapefiles or other necessary data), and user configurations from the previous execution.
5. **File Update/Creation**: Every time the program closes, this file is updated if it exists or created in the executable folder if not already present.
